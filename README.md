# Bioassay Activity Prediction

We come from https://www.epa.gov/comptox-tools/exploring-toxcast-data#Download Download ToxCast Database: invitrodb version 3.5 (version 10). After organizing the data, a classification dataset with activity and a regression dataset with AC<sub>50</sub>values were obtained. The methodology is detailed in the research article *"Shifting Pesticide Use in Agriculture: Evolving Human Health Risk Implications from 1992 to 2017"* (In preparation).

The code is divided into two parts:

1. Classification_wide_data.py，Prediction model for classification datasets
2. Regression_wide_data.py，Prediction model for regression dataset

Both modules are fully written in Python. The author is **Yuan Chi**.
